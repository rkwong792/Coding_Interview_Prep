# Tree Problems Notes

'''

 A lot of recursion problems that use DFS has O(N) time complexity where N is the # of nodes in the tree.
 These recursion problems that use DFS has a O(h) space complexity because of the recursive call stack.

 DFS problems use pre-order traversal a lot (Root -> Left -> Right)

 If you are doing breadth first search (AKA level order traversal), you need to use a queue FIFO data structure.
 In Python, this is a deque (double ended queue).
