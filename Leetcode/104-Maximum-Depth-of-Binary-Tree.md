# Maximum Depth of Binary Tree

> - Difficulty: Easy
> - Type: Trees

## Solution
- Time complexity: O(n) - Since each node in the tree is visited only once where 'n' is the # if nodes in the tree.
- Space complexity: O(h) function calls will be placed on the call stack in the worst case, where h is the height of the tree. Because h âˆˆ O(n), the space complexity is O(n).

```python
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        
        # BFS / Level order traversal
        
        if not root: return 0
        
        level = 0
        q = deque()
        q.append(root)
        
        while q:
            for i in range(len(q)):
                node = q.popleft()
                if node.left:
                    q.append(node.left)
                if node.right:
                    q.append(node.right)
            level += 1
        return level
