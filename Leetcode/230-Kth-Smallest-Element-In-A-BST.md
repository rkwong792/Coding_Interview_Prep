# 230. Kth Smallest Element in a BST

> - Difficulty: Medium
> - Type: Trees
> - [link](https://leetcode.com/problems/kth-smallest-element-in-a-bst/)

## Solution
- Time complexity: O(H + k)
- Space complexity: O(h) function calls will be placed on the call stack in the worst case, where h is the height of the tree. Because h âˆˆ O(n), the space complexity is O(n).

```python
class Solution:
    def kthSmallest(self, root: Optional[TreeNode], k: int) -> int:
        
        stack = []
        curr = root
        
        while stack or curr:
            while curr:
                stack.append(curr)
                curr = curr.left
            curr = stack.pop()
            k -= 1
            if k == 0:
                return curr.val
            curr = curr.right
```
